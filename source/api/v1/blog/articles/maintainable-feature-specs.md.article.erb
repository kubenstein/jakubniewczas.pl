Features specs are specs in which a whole feature is considered a unit. Each programmer may understand what "a feature" is a bit different but for me features specs are usually related with end-to-end testing - testing a system by simulating user actions and behaviour against system UI.
I noticed that the key to have readable and maintainable specs is to pay a great attention not to mix code abstraction levels. I wrote a [separate blog post](#/blog/why-do-we-write-functions) about this, feel free to check it.

### Structure
I follow `given, when, then` structures but I often skip writing those words explicitly. Especially `given` word or whole its part can be omitted. From a client/spec reader perspective some parts are implicitly obvious. It is obvious that there is a user and that user is already logged in. Or that we have to visit the main page first.

I try to move those steps out of a spec block, leaving only the essence of what is being tested.
Adding user creation or logging step will just decrease spec readability.

`Then` word also can be skipped in most cases because most cases have only one final assertion. However sometimes if we want to emphasise testing a change in a system, adding `then` may improve readability.

```
it('allows to change user nickname', () => {
  when.openingSideMenu();
  and.settingNickname('Jakub');
  userCanSeeNickname('Jakub');
});
```

I encapsulate every single action in a well named corresponding step helper. Clicking tests often have to operate on a DOM elements which from spec perspective is a not important detail. Sometimes steps can be reusable, often though, it is just 1-1 relation.

### Scaling
At the beginning I put all steps in a single file. After a while patterns will emerge naturally. Usually steps are grouped by type: `given`, `when`, `then` or by system area like `login page`, `settings page` etc. If it becomes too clumsy and unreadable, I split and extract steps into separate files. File structure is not that important - true structure will emerge eventually.


Before, I used to add `given, when, then` words as prefixes to spec helpers method names: `whenVisitingMainPage()`, but recently I found an interesting approach to make things even more readable.

In JS, but I think in ruby would be also easy to implement, my steps definition file looks like:

```
const expect = require('chai').expect;

module.exports = function steps() {
  this.when = this.and = this.then = this.following = this.again = when = then = this;

  when.visitingMainPage = function () {
    browser.url('/');
  };

  when.loggingIn = function (email, password) {
    browser.setValue('input[name=email]', email);
    browser.setValue('input[name=password]', password);
    browser.$('.btn').click();
  };

  when.openingSideMenu = function () {
    const sidemenuTrigger = browser.$('.side-menu-trigger');
    sidemenuTrigger.click();
  };

  //...

  then.userCanSeeColumn = function (title) {
    const columnNames = browser.getValue('input.column-title');
    expect(columnNames).to.include(title);
  };
};
```

The magic happens at a first line:
```
this.when = this.and = this.then = this.following = this.again = when = then = this;
```

With this line I can prefix method inside and outside of steps module. Inside, I can clearly separate actions and assertions: `when.openingSideMenu` vs  `then.userCanSeeColumn`. Outside I can do the same to emphasize spec actions flow.

I added a few more words like `and`, `again` and `following` so I can buitd more readable chains like `when.again.openingCardDetails(...)`.

```
it('allows to change a description', () => {
  when.openingCardDetails('cardTitle');
  and.changingCardDescription('new description');
  and.reloading();
  and.again.openingCardDetails('cardTitle');
  userCanSeeDescription('new description');
});
```

With such a carefully crafted js module , all I need to make those steps available in my test suite, is:

```
require('./support/steps.js')();

describe('Specs', () => {
  // steps are accessible here with spec scope injected,
  // i.e. browser object is available there
});
```
