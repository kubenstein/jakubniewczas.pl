This is step by step short guide how to install and use iOS Simulator to test your website on different iOS devises.

Having an ability to test UI and UX on several devises at once is a huge advantage and productivity boost, especially when installing is so simple. By using Simulators we are one step closer to real environment allowing devs and designers spotting potential issues faster.

### Step 1/5
First we need to install Xcode (we won't use it but we need to have it installed).
The easiest way is to go to AppStore and install it for free.
Alternatively you can download it from [https://developer.apple.com/download/more/](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/). Please not that you can also download earlier versions of Xcode, which is especially useful if you haven't yet updated your mac system.

### Step 2/5
After Xcode has been installed, open it and go to its preferences. Then open "components" tab and install latest iOS Simulator.

### Step 3/5
Open Simulator.

- To add more devices go to `Hardware -> Device -> iOS` and just add as many devices as you want.
- I prefer to have device outlines disabled. To do so go to Window and uncheck "Show Device Bezels".

### Step 4/5
Open Safari from within an iPhone or iPad and simply navigate to desired website. You have also access to `localhost` to target development server.

### Step 5/5
To debug a site using a web inspector open Safari on your mac (not on iPhone!). Go to Develop menu, pick a simulator and a page you want to inspect. You are now ready to start debugging using Safari dev tools!
