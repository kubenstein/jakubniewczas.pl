“Keep all aspects of a project in one place together! A card-based management tool that stores its data in a git repo.”

Whenever I work as a freelancer or craft my own projects I can’t imagine not having a task manager. Organise, prioritise and separate tasks from each other bring order, rise predictability and makes me more confident about a project status. Status of every required feature or submitted bug can be quickly described and tracked.


Even long after project is finished, there are some maintenance tasks to implement. It happened to me too many times that Trello/Pivotal was already closed, dropbox unshared and a missing important file was basically lost for good. What if I can archive those files in a same, simple way as I archive source code...

That’s how Starboard was born, to keep EVERYTHING in a same place! I choose that place to be a git repo.

I decided to use git because it is well established way of sharing/archiving source code. Git repo is usually the main, but not the only part of a project. Git provides consistency, security, distributed aspect and wildly available hosting solutions. Having permission to access project source code usually also means you should have access to task manager and related files.

After prototyping phase I decided to go with EventSourcing approach because git in its core is also event sourced - we keep deltas and recreate current state every time we do a `git checkout <branch>`.

I started using Starboard to manage itself even when there was no layout, no drag and drop, no configs, no labels and comments. Being a maintainer and a user at same times greatly improved motivation and quality. It was also nice to see project evolution. Enjoying features that became available right after `npm run dev:localRelease`.

### Technical aspects
The shortest explanation: task manager stores it’s state as series of events that are stored as git commit messages.

Event Sourcing and frontend/backend communication is covered by my previous [blogpost](#/blog/current-state-in-event-sourcing).

Events are synced by git rebasing existing events on top on the remote list. After rebasing, events delta is applied. Event Handlers have to be prepared that something may not make any sense anymore, like updating a card after it was removed. Alternatively I could rebase remote events on top on local, but it would require force push. I was considering force push inspired by blockchains mechanic but I still prefer not to modify public repo.

### Production Readiness
I use Starboard for quite a while already but mostly in a single user mode. Storage in my case is usually Dropbox but I successfully ran Starboard with Bitbucket as well.

Feel free to submit suggestions or PRs. All feedback is welcome.

### The goal

The long term goal is to build whole `star*` ecosystem of tools that use git under the hood. This will allow to fully utilize distributed aspect of git.

The ecosystem already has another tool, a glueing layer called `Starbucket` please read the [corresponding blogpost](#/blog/starbucket-reintroduce-distributed-aspect-of-git). I believe Starboard on top of Starbucket can be really powerful combination making companies less depended on 3rd party services.

```
npm install -g starboard
```
