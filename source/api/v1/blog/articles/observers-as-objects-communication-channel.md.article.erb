Observer Pattern is an extremely handy way to implement communication channel between two or more objects. Thanks to its simplicity, it allows to have a full control over a communication contract. It solves, in an easy way, problem of returning multiple values from a function and naturally and gently forces us to follow *Tell Don’t Ask* principle. It emphasises importance of messages and can be nearly transparently replaced with more advances async message queues approaches. 

I [developed a convention](/#/blog/what-kind-of-code-I-want-to-see-in-controllers) how to build and use objects in that way. I like to separate objects by their Command or Query nature. 

### Query
If an object is a Query, I force passing at least one observer via constructor. By having this requirement, user of a class will be reminded that purpose of the class is to return some data. Additionally you can add more observers if needed but this is done by a separate method call.

```ruby
class SomeClass 
  def call 
    PullRequestValidator.new( 
      pull_request: PullRequest.new(@params), 
      result_handler: self 
    ).call 
  end  

  def pull_request_valid(pull_request) 
  end  

  def pull_request_not_valid(invalid_pull_request, pull_request_errors) 
  end
 end 
```

The question that popped in our heads is: ok but how do I know what callbacks a particular class expects? The answer is very trivial, Since we expect collbacks invocations, it is not that hard to scan code of a class. In my case it's `notify(:callback_name, params)` method. It would be really handy to have interfaces that force us to fulfil contracts but after following, for a while, I realised that discovering a class contract is not a problem.

```ruby
class PullRequestValidator 
  include Notifiable  

  def initialize(pull_request:, result_handler:) 
    @pull_request = pull_request 
    add_observer(result_handler) 
  end  

  def call 
    if valid? 
      notify(:pull_request_valid, @pull_request) 
    else 
      notify(:pull_request_not_valid, @pull_request, errors) 
    end
  end

  #...
 end

``` 

### Command
If an object is a Command, receiving any result is not obligatory. However it is often handy to be notified about status of execution. In that case I configure observers as a separate `add_observer()` method call.
```
CreatePullRequestCommand.new(params: params[:pull_request]) 
                        .add_observer(self) 
                        .call
```

### Implementation 

Ruby provides `Observable` functionality in the language standard library, however I found its API problematic and not hard to work with. Mostly because it can callback only to one function. Additionally implementing Observers from scratch is extremely easy. I called it `Notifiable` because thats the true purpose, to notify not to being observed. I think this subtle difference also fits well in *Tell Don’t Ask* principle.

```ruby
module Notifiable 
  def add_observer(observer) 
    (@observers ||= []) << observer 
    self
  end

  def notify(method_name, *args) 
    (@observers ||= []).each do |observer| 
      observer.send(method_name, *args) 
    end
  end
 end
```
